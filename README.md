The development of a 3D game engine using Vulkan, as presented in this thesis, showcases the potential of leveraging low-level graphics APIs to achieve high performance and flexibility in rendering tasks.
Throughout this project, we explored various aspects of Vulkan, including initialization, memory management, and pipeline configuration, as well as implemented key components such as camera control, lighting systems, and user interfaces.
By building a game engine from scratch, we demonstrated how Vulkanâ€™s capabilities can be utilized for efficient memory handling and rendering, providing deeper insights into modern game development practices. 
The resulting engine not only serves as a testament to the power of Vulkan but also as a versatile platform for further exploration and optimization in 3D graphics and interactive applications.
Overall, this thesis underscores the importance of understanding lower-level APIs like Vulkan for developing advanced, performance-oriented graphical applications.
The knowledge gained from this project lays a strong foundation for future developments and research in the field of computer graphics and game engine architecture.
